/*===== Hero =====*/
// "The mascot lives in the layout": the paws image is cut flat at the chest, 87% down, which is exactly where the sage
// card's top edge sits. The card is behind the image (z-0 vs z-10), so the paws drape over its border while the body
// seems to stand behind it. Card geometry hangs off the image box (`top-[87%]`), so it holds at every size.
//
// From lg up the hero is exactly one laptop screen, from a 1280×720 to a 2560×1600 at 150%:
// the section takes the screen less the header (4.75rem) and the 2.25rem of ground showing under it, the grid
// stretches so the card lands on its bottom, and the dog and headline are sized by the screen's height. The dog's
// height is the screen less 13.5rem (header, ground, the card's 5rem below him and a little air), times 285/463 for
// his width. He stops at 23rem, ~1.3x the cut-out's natural width, so a tall screen gets air rather than a soft dog:
// the dog and copy are centred in the height, and the card runs down to the section's bottom (clipped there, under
// the ground), so the spare height is shared between the air above him and the card below.
