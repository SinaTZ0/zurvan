/*===== Sign-in Flow =====*/
/**
 * Phone → code → (first time only) name, or phone → password. Signing in and signing up are the same two steps (spec 2):
 * a number seen for the first time becomes a customer account when its code is verified, and only then is the name asked.
 * A password can only be set after that, from the profile page, so the password step is for people who already have an
 * account; one who forgot theirs takes the code step and is sent on to set a new one.
 *
 * The steps sit on one grained plate. A new step's title and form rise in (`answer-in` on a wrapper keyed by the step's
 * name; a resend keeps the name, so the code step doesn't replay), but not on the page's first paint: the form is there
 * from the start and only a move the person made animates.
