/*===== Dog Form =====*/
/**
 * The whole body of the page that adds a dog or edits one: the header the page passes in, the print mount (the
 * customer's dog's photo as a taped print that is also the picker, its name stamped as it is typed, its bubble) and the
 * form in four plates (who it is, its body, its health papers, its training), each looked after by the center's dog on
 * its top edge. One `useForm` holds every field either way.
 *
 * **A new dog** (`step` is a number) goes one plate per step, the step in the URL (`?step=`): the road above the plate
 * shows where the owner is; «بعدی» checks only this step's fields and pushes the next step onto history (so a phone's
 * back button goes back a step); the health and training steps can be left for later («بعداً»), and the last step
 * saves. A step opened by URL while an earlier step still has a red field goes back to it (`replace`). What is typed
 * is kept as a draft in `sessionStorage` until the dog is saved (`draft.ts`; the photos' uploads are not). An error,
 * the form's own or the server's, takes the owner to the step of its first field and focuses it.
 *
 * **An edit** (`step` is null) shows the four plates on one page with a jump list under the header, and saves
 * everything. Once the dog is evaluated its breed type, breed(s) and birth date are locked (app-spec F2): shown, not
 * editable, and submitted as stored.
 *
 * Saving a new dog goes to the Dashboard and saving an edit to the dog's page, or either goes back to `redirectTo`
 * when another page sent the owner here.
 *
 * **Who speaks:** one plate's dog at a time. A new dog's step is its plate's; on the edit page it is the identity
 * plate's on load, and focus moving into another plate hands him the word. A failed check gives it to the first plate
 * with an error, who says the error line while the form focuses its first red field.
