/**
 * F7: at each paid purchase of a customer with an active partner, writes one commission: a percentage of the total of
 * the enrollments that payment created, rounded down to the Rial. The percent is the step the partner's paying
 * customers are on, counting this customer: a new customer may lift the partner to the next step, a repeat buyer
 * doesn't. Commissions already written keep their percent; a step only applies from the purchase that reaches it.
 *
 * Runs inside the callback's transaction, with the partner's row locked so their customers are counted one at a time.
 * Nothing is written when the payment created no enrollment (there is no base to take a share of), and that customer
 * doesn't count until a purchase of theirs does. The unique index on the payment keeps it to one per payment.
 *
 * @returns Whether a commission was written.
